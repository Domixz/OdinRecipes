  <p>Brown Sugar Cookies made with dark brown sugar and butter are sweet, soft,
   chewy, and the PERFECT spin on the traditional cookie ready in under 30 minutes!</p>
  <p>there is potential for changing up the recipe a bit, i.e. you can use light brown or
    even white sugar (although that might make the cookies less soft and crumble more easily)
     or use brown butter instead of regular for a deeper flavor. </p>
  <p><strong> Ingredients: </strong> </p>
   <ul>
    <li><em>14 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 ¾ sticks)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
    <li>2 cups packed dark brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 cups flour , plus 2 tablespoons</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li><em>
   </ul>

  <h3> The recipe: </h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>In a skillet melt 10 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat. Whisk constantly until butter starts to brown, about 3-4 minutes. Pour into bowl, add remaining butter to same bowl and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl whisk together sugar, ¼ cup brown sugar, flour, baking soda, and baking powder.</li>
    <li>Add remaining brown sugar and salt to butter and whisk until smooth. Whisk in egg, egg yolk, and vanilla.</li>
    <li>Combine butter mixture with dry ingredients, stirring until a dough forms.</li>
    <li>Either roll dough out to 1/2-inch thick and use a cookie cutter, or roll into a ball and place on cookie sheet. Sprinkle with sugar.</li>
    <li>Bake for 12-14 minutes, or until cookies begin to set.</li>
   </ol>
