  <p>One of the many great things about these wafer cookies is that they take
  little time, and they’re easy to make, fuss-free with very basic ingredients.</p>
  <p><strong>and here's the list of those</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Butter. For perfect flavor (and for complete control over that flavor), I use unsalted butter and add salt. If you only have salted butter on hand just reduce the salt that the recipe calls for to ¼ teaspoon.</li>
    <li>Vanilla extract. You need quite a bit of vanilla for this recipe: 4 teaspoons. Fortunately, if you don’t feel inclined to dip into your stockpile of the “good stuff” (anyone else make homemade vanilla extract?) this recipe works well with imitation instead. In fact, it may even give you a flavor that’s closer to the vanilla cookies sold in a yellow box at the store…</li>
    <li>Egg. Just one! I tried this recipe with no eggs (too crumbly, dry, and all-around lacking), just the yolk (too tender, didn’t spread enough), just the white (not as good as using both the yolk and egg) and ultimately settled with one single egg.</li>
    <li>All-purpose flour. I tested this recipe with all-purpose and cake flour hoping for a finer crumb and a slightly more crumbly results with cake flour. To my surprise, the all-purpose flour won every time. Possibly also worth noting: I tried many versions using cornstarch (one of my favorite secret ingredients). I was sure it would help me get the consistency I was looking for, but ultimately that proved to not be the case!</li>
    <li>Milk. I recommend and personally use whole milk but I suppose 2% would work in a pinch. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3> And here's the recipe: </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Beat together sugar and butter, then stir in eggs and vanilla extract.</li>
    <li>Separately, whisk together dry ingredients. Stir half into the wet ingredients, then stir in your milk, then the rest of the dry ingredients. This just makes a more cohesive batter than if you were to add the milk with the butter mixture (where it tends to separate).</li>
    <li>Drop the dough by rounded spoonful onto a baking sheet, spacing cookies 2 inches (5cm) apart. This is a fairly soft dough.</li>
    <li>Lightly flatten the dough with dampened fingertips. This encourages them to spread jusssssttt enough and to cook evenly, otherwise they may end up too thick, meaning centers that are softer and chewier than they ought to be (vanilla wafers should be thinner and crisp!).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>When they’re finished baking, the cookies will be pale golden in color with
     deeper golden edges. If you flip one over, the edge should be deep golden in
      color as well. If yours isn’t, it may just need more time in the oven.</p>
      <p>and that is the way of the wafer. Hope you enjoyed and we wish to see you visit our website again! :)</p>
